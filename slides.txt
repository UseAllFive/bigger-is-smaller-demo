We have clients.




Clients want more buzzwords.





Like: Retina friendly.




And: Responsive.





     oi.




To make an image look good on retina, we save it as 2x the dimensions, which yeilds a ~4x larger image size.



Responsive designs help solve the problem of small screens.  Small screen devices usually have slow internet connections, which would do better with smaller files sizes.



SO... We need images that look GREAT! on big screens, but download fast on slow devices...  Can it be done?




We think so!...  
    (if its a JPG)





If you have an image with 2x dimensions, saved as a MUCH lower JPG quality, you get an image with many more, but smaller artifacts.
